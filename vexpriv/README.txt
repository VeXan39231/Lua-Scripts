This is VeXPriv, the newest addition to my GitHub.

VeXPriv is an addon based off of an idea I got while using TeamSpeak.

This addon creates a 'privilege key' system, allowing a server owner/staff member to gain superadmin instantly in any time of need, without the use of a server console.

The user can create their own privilege key for personal use.

To create a privilige key with this addon installed, go to your client's console and type 'privkey' and a menu will open up. Follow the instructions from then on.
